ITERATION 4 ACTION PLAN

CURRENT ISSUES:
1. Video length 1 hour but shows "webinar ended" after 30 minutes
2. Two controllers for webinar room - need to remove unused one

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

ISSUE 1 - PREMATURE WEBINAR ENDING:
1. IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE:
   - Hardcoded 30-minute fallback in checkWebinarStatus function
   - When video duration not detected, it assumed 30 minutes as default
   - This caused 1-hour videos to end prematurely at 30-minute mark

2. FIXED DURATION LOGIC:
   - Replaced hardcoded 30-minute fallback with webinar scheduled duration
   - First tries to use actual video duration (when available)
   - Fallback 1: Use webinar.duration from schedule (e.g., 60 minutes)
   - Fallback 2: Ultimate 60-minute limit if no duration info available
   - Added debug logging to show which duration source is being used

ISSUE 2 - DUPLICATE CONTROLLERS:
1. IDENTIFIED CONTROLLERS:
   - webinar-room.controller.js (unused)
   - webinar-room-simple.controller.js (active)

2. CLEANUP PERFORMED:
   - Removed unused webinar-room.controller.js file
   - Kept webinar-room-simple.controller.js as the single controller
   - Previously updated index.html to load correct controller

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Duration logic now respects actual webinar scheduled duration
- 1-hour webinars will now run for full 60 minutes instead of stopping at 30
- Removed code duplication by eliminating unused controller file
- Cleaner codebase with single webinar room controller

EXPECTED RESULT:
1. 1-hour videos will play for full duration without premature ending
2. Single controller file reduces confusion and maintenance overhead
3. Webinar ending logic now uses proper duration hierarchy: video > scheduled > 60min fallback

STATUS: Waiting for feedback on iteration 4 fix

Changes this iteration:
- main.css: Tightened mobile styles for control buttons and badges
	- At <=768px: smaller ctrl-btn/control-button sizes and reduced gaps
	- At <=640px: decreased padding, gap, and button sizes; tuned live/participant badges
	- At <=480px: ensured compact controls remain readable

Next: Re-read issues.txt for updated feedback; verify HTML updates reflect due to template cache busting and no inline styles remain.
