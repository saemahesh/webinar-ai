**Action Plan - Iteration 8**

**Current Issue**: 
- Mobile video playback issues on Android phones
- Videos downloading multiple times
- Need to start video only once with real-time timestamp based on start time

**Analysis**:
- Multiple video download requests suggest multiple play attempts
- Android mobile browsers have different video handling requirements
- Need to implement proper video state management
- Real-time timestamp calculation needs to be done once and cached

**Solution Plan**:
1. Add video loading state management to prevent multiple downloads
2. Implement single video initialization with proper timestamp calculation
3. Add mobile-specific video handling for Android
4. Prevent duplicate play attempts

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add video loading state tracking
2. Implement single initialization logic
3. Add mobile/Android specific handling
4. Prevent multiple download attempts
