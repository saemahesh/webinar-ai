ITERATION 0 - ACTION PLAN

Goal: Ensure mobile landscape uses full width for video, auto-hides chat, and shows control panel at bottom.

Changes this iteration:
- CSS (webinar-room.html):
	- Hide chat panel entirely in landscape to remove gap.
	- Show control panel fixed at bottom (50px) and resize video height to calc(100vh - 50px).
- Controller (webinar-room-simple.controller.js): Keep auto-hide behavior for chat in mobile landscape.

Next: Re-check issues.txt for updated feedback and iterate.
