ITERATION 10 - WEBINAR ROOM UI IMPROVEMENTS

Status: ✅ COMPLETED - WAITING FOR USER TESTING FEEDBACK

Issues addressed:
1. ✅ Hide participant count when "Time remaining" is showing
   - Added ng-hide="roomState.status === 'waiting'" to participant count element
   - Participant count now only shows when webinar is live/ended, not during waiting

2. ✅ Smart resume button and auto-play video functionality
   - Added intelligent showResumeButton logic to webinar-room.controller.js
   - Implemented auto-play with audio unmuting on webinar room entry
   - Resume button only shows when video is actually paused and webinar is live
   - Hidden during waiting/ended states
   - Auto-play attempts when entering room, shows resume only if blocked by browser
   - Added checkVideoState() function for smart state management

Code changes made:
- webinar-room.html: Added ng-hide condition for participant count
- webinar-room.controller.js: Added showResumeButton, resumeVideo(), checkVideoState() functions
- Enhanced auto-play logic with audio enablement and smart resume control
- Integrated state checks in checkWebinarStatus() function

Technical implementation:
- Participant count visibility: ng-hide="roomState.status === 'waiting'"
- Resume button visibility: Only when video.paused && webinar is live
- Auto-play: Attempts on entry, muted=false, shows resume only if fails
- State management: Checks video state on room initialization and status changes

Waiting for user testing and feedback on:
- Participant count visibility during countdown
- Resume button behavior and auto-play functionality
- Video audio playback working correctly
