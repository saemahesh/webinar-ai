ITERATION 12 ACTION PLAN - CRITICAL RESUME BUTTON FIX

CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Resume button not showing up on page load or countdown completion
Root Cause: Recent mobile optimizations were starting videos muted, causing paused-state checks to fail

Problem Areas Fixed:
1. ✅ COUNTDOWN COMPLETION LOGIC
   - Previously checked if video was paused before showing resume button
   - Fixed: Always show resume button when countdown reaches 0
   - Ensures users can unmute and start video with proper interaction

2. ✅ PAGE LOAD LOGIC (checkForResumeState)
   - Previously required video to be paused to show resume button
   - Fixed: Always show resume button for live webinars if user hasn't resumed
   - Critical for page refresh scenarios and direct access to live webinars

3. ✅ INITIALIZATION LOGIC (initializeRoom)
   - Previously checked video.paused state to determine resume button display
   - Fixed: Show resume button for all live webinars unless user has already resumed
   - Ensures consistent behavior across all entry points

Key Changes Made:
- Countdown completion: Removed video.paused check, always show resume button
- checkForResumeState(): Removed video.paused requirement, show for all live webinars
- initializeRoom(): Use hasUserResumed flag instead of video.paused state
- Enhanced logging to track resume button display logic

Why This Was Critical:
❌ Before: Users could enter live webinars with no way to unmute/start video
❌ Audio stayed muted with no user interaction option
❌ Mobile optimizations conflicted with resume button logic

✅ After: Resume button always appears when needed
✅ Users can always interact to unmute and start video
✅ Consistent behavior across page load, countdown, and refresh scenarios

Expected User Experience:
1. Page loads on live webinar → Resume button appears
2. Countdown reaches 0 → Resume button appears  
3. User clicks resume → Video starts with audio
4. Video plays normally with user control

This fix ensures the fundamental user interaction flow works correctly!
