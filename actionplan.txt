ITERATION 0 - ACTION PLAN

Goal: Make the webinar room control panel responsive on mobile; reduce oversized icons/buttons and spacing.

Changes this iteration:
- main.css: Tightened mobile styles for control buttons and badges
	- At <=768px: smaller ctrl-btn/control-button sizes and reduced gaps
	- At <=640px: decreased padding, gap, and button sizes; tuned live/participant badges
	- At <=480px: ensured compact controls remain readable

Next: Re-read issues.txt for updated feedback; if icons still feel large or overlap, further reduce sizes or stack layout.
