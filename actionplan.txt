ITERATION 6 ACTION PLAN

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Video controls should be visible on webinar details page
- Currently hidden globally on all pages due to iteration 2 changes
- Need to scope video control hiding to webinar room page only

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
- In iteration 2, added global CSS rules to hide video controls
- Rules used generic "video" selector affecting all pages
- Webinar details page needs to show controls for user interaction
- Only webinar room page should have controls hidden

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. IDENTIFIED PAGE-SPECIFIC SELECTOR:
   - Webinar room page uses .webinar-room-container class
   - This provides unique identifier to scope CSS rules
   - Other pages (like webinar details) don't have this class

2. UPDATED CSS SPECIFICITY:
   - Changed all video control hiding rules from global to page-specific
   - Added .webinar-room-container prefix to all selectors
   - Examples:
     * Old: video::-webkit-media-controls { display: none !important; }
     * New: .webinar-room-container video::-webkit-media-controls { display: none !important; }

3. COMPREHENSIVE SCOPE CHANGE:
   - Updated webkit media controls (Chrome/Safari)
   - Updated moz media controls (Firefox) 
   - Updated appearance settings for video[controls]
   - All rules now scoped to webinar room container only

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Video controls will be visible by default on all pages
- Only webinar room page (.webinar-room-container) will hide controls
- Webinar details page will show native video controls
- Other pages with videos will have normal controls behavior

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Webinar details page: Video controls visible ✓
- Webinar room page: Video controls hidden ✓  
- Clean separation of control visibility by page context

STATUS: Waiting for feedback on iteration 6 fix

Changes this iteration:
- main.css: Tightened mobile styles for control buttons and badges
	- At <=768px: smaller ctrl-btn/control-button sizes and reduced gaps
	- At <=640px: decreased padding, gap, and button sizes; tuned live/participant badges
	- At <=480px: ensured compact controls remain readable

Next: Re-read issues.txt for updated feedback; verify HTML updates reflect due to template cache busting and no inline styles remain.
