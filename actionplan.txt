**Iteration 3 Action Plan**

**Previous Issue Status**: 
❌ My previous fix made it worse - increased video height caused more wasted space

**Current Issue to Fix**:
- Decrease height of video in mobile mode, some space is wasting 
- The video will be always in landscape mode
- **NEW**: "now it is wasting lot more space (height)"

**Problem Analysis**:
- I increased video from 35vh → 50vh but that made it worse
- Since videos are landscape, they don't need much vertical space in portrait mobile
- Need to DECREASE video height significantly to minimize wasted space
- Landscape videos in portrait containers will have black bars (letterboxing)

**Solution**: 
- Reduce video area height to around 25vh or even smaller (20vh)
- Give chat area more space since that's more useful in portrait mobile
- Keep landscape mode at 100vh (that's fine for landscape videos)
