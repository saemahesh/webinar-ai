ITERATION 0 - ACTION PLAN
Iteration 1 plan:
1) Controls not visible after resume - fixed resume overlay covering controls (bottom: 60px instead of 0).
2) Explicitly enable controls in resumeVideo() function via JS (video.controls = true).
3) Lowered resume overlay z-index from 1000 to 500 to prevent blocking controls.
4) Next: if still not visible, check if video element is properly loaded and controls are supported.
Goal: Make the webinar room control panel responsive on mobile; reduce oversized icons/buttons and spacing.

Changes this iteration:
- main.css: Tightened mobile styles for control buttons and badges
	- At <=768px: smaller ctrl-btn/control-button sizes and reduced gaps
	- At <=640px: decreased padding, gap, and button sizes; tuned live/participant badges
	- At <=480px: ensured compact controls remain readable

Next: Re-read issues.txt for updated feedback; verify HTML updates reflect due to template cache busting and no inline styles remain.
