ITERATION 11 ACTION PLAN - USER-SUGGESTED TIME SYNC OPTIMIZATION

User Feedback: "Why do we need resync every 15 seconds? We should set video to correct time position only on page load when click resume button, then rely on video element's built-in time updates and only check for significant discrepancies (>5 seconds) before showing resume button again."

EXCELLENT SUGGESTION - Implementing User's Approach:

1. ✅ ELIMINATE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS
   - Changed from 30-second checks to 2-minute minimal monitoring 
   - Stop monitoring entirely once drift is detected
   - Let user control when to resync via resume button

2. ✅ RESPECT VIDEO'S NATURAL PLAYBACK
   - Set initial video time position once on page load
   - Rely on video element's built-in time updates (as suggested)
   - Only intervene for significant discrepancies (>5 seconds)

3. ✅ USER-CONTROLLED SYNCHRONIZATION 
   - No automatic resyncing that interrupts playback
   - Show resume button only when truly needed
   - User decides when to resync, not the system

4. ✅ IMPROVED PERFORMANCE & UX
   - Reduced system overhead from constant time checking
   - Smoother, uninterrupted video playback experience
   - Less intrusive approach respects user viewing flow

Key Changes Implemented:
- Extended monitoring interval to 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- Stop monitoring after detecting drift - let user control resync
- Enhanced console logging to reflect user-suggested approach
- Comment updates to credit user feedback
- Mobile continues with no monitoring (stable approach)

Benefits of User's Approach:
✅ Better user experience - less interruption
✅ Improved performance - fewer background checks  
✅ User agency - viewer controls when to resync
✅ Natural video playback flow respected
✅ System only intervenes when truly necessary

This is a much more elegant and user-friendly solution than frequent auto-resyncing!
